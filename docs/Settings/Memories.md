## **Memories YAML Documentation**

### **Overview**

The `memories.yaml` file is essential for initializing memory collections and preloading them with initial data. It aids in managing and setting up memory repositories for the system's operations.

### **Formatting Guidelines**

- Memory collection names should adhere to the Python variable naming convention.
- Each collection can be initialized with default data or left empty.
