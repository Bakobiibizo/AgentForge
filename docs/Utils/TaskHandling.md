# Task Handling Documentation

## Overview

`TaskHandling` in AgentForge is a utility class that facilitates the management of tasks stored in the system. It provides methods to retrieve, order, and display tasks, enhancing the workflow and task management capabilities within the system.

## Methods and Examples

### get_current_task

Retrieves the first incomplete task from the task list.

#### Usage Example:

```python
task_handler = TaskHandling()
current_task = task_handler.get_current_task()
# Returns the first 'not completed' task
```

### get_ordered_task_list

Retrieves and orders tasks based on a specified attribute, such as 'Order'.

#### Usage Example:

```python
task_handler = TaskHandling()
ordered_tasks = task_handler.get_ordered_task_list()
# Returns tasks ordered by their 'Order' attribute
```

### log_tasks

Logs task details to a file, useful for tracking and auditing task progress.

#### Usage Example:

```python
tasks = "Task 1: Completed\nTask 2: Not Completed"
TaskHandling.log_tasks(tasks)
# Logs the task details to a file
```

### show_task_list

Displays a list of tasks, sorted and formatted, with their status highlighted.

#### Usage Example:

```python
task_handler = TaskHandling()
task_list = task_handler.show_task_list("Current Tasks")
# Displays and logs the sorted task list with each task's status
```

## Practical Application

The `TaskHandling` class is particularly useful in scenarios where tasks need to be managed, tracked, and displayed systematically. It helps in maintaining an organized flow of tasks, ensuring that each task is addressed in its order of priority.

## Note on Future Developments

`TaskHandling` is subject to ongoing improvements and updates. We are actively working on enhancing the flexibility of task structures and management within the system. Users will be able to define and manage tasks more dynamically in future updates.
