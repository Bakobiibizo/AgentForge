# Modules Overview

## Introduction to Modules

In the AgentForge framework, modules represent a sophisticated orchestration layer that sits above individual agents. While agents are the executors of specific tasks, modules are the conductors, coordinating various agents to manage information flow and decision-making processes. This higher level of orchestration ensures that diverse agents work in harmony to achieve complex, overarching objectives.

### The Role of Modules

Modules are designed to:

- Coordinate multiple agents and their interactions.
- Handle complex decision-making processes that require input from various sources.
- Manage the overarching logic that guides agents towards a common goal.

By integrating modules into the framework, users can create intricate workflows that are both scalable and adaptable to new challenges.

### Generic Scope

Modules are generic in scope, providing a framework that can be applied to a wide range of use cases.
They are not limited to specific tasks but are instead built to be versatile,
capable of handling tasks that benefit from multi-agent coordination.

## Detailed Examples

Within the AgentForge framework, we are developing specialized modules that leverage our robust agent system to achieve specific objectives:

- **[Action Execution Module](ActionExecution.md)**: A key component in our system, the Action Execution Module is responsible for the orderly execution of actions derived from the task list provided by the Salience Module. It ensures that each action is carried out in a manner that aligns with the system's goals and priorities.

- **Salience Module (In Development)**: This advanced module is designed to take a high-level goal and decompose it into a series of smaller, manageable tasks. It functions by intelligently planing a series of tasks and systematically addressing each one, utilizing a suite of in-house agents and the **Action Execution** Module to bring the overarching goal to fruition. Once fully implemented, the Salience Module will serve as a central orchestrator, directing various agents and modules in a cohesive effort to achieve complex objectives.

> **Note on Salience Module Development**: The Salience Module, as described, is not yet in existence within the AgentForge framework. Our in-house cognitive architecture/bot, known as Salience Bot, demonstrates the conceptual functionality intended for the Salience Module. However, Salience Bot is not currently formatted as a module. We are undertaking efforts to refactor Salience Bot into a modular format that will be compatible with and usable by any cognitive architecture or bot within the system. This transformation is aimed at providing a scalable and reusable solution for goal-oriented task management. Documentation and updates will be provided once the Salience Module is fully developed and implemented.

## Recursive and Multi-Module Implementations

Modules can be designed to call other modules, forming recursive structures or multi-module scripts. This recursive nature allows for the creation of complex cognitive architectures or bots, which can be as simple or as sophisticated as required by the task at hand.

### Integration with Cognitive Architectures

To integrate a module within a cognitive architecture or another module:

```python
from agentforge.modules.SpecificModule import ModuleClass

module = ModuleClass()
results = module.run() # Assuming the Module Class has a method called run
```

Modules can be imported and utilized just like any Python class, with their methods called and attributes passed as needed. This flexibility enables users to construct powerful cognitive architectures that leverage the full capabilities of the AgentForge system.
