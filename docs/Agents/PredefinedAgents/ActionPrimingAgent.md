# Action Priming Agent

## Introduction

`ActionPrimingAgent` is a specialized agent that extends the base `Agent` class. This agent is specifically designed for priming tools based on defined actions, it also performs customized loading of additional data, output building, and skips the saving of results to memory.

Each agent, including the `ActionPrimingAgent`, is associated with a specific prompt `YAML` file which determines its interactions. This file contains a set of pre-defined prompts templates that guide the agent's behavior during its execution. For a detailed understanding of how these prompts are structured and utilized, you can refer to our [Prompts Documentation](../AgentPrompts.md). To view the specific prompts associated with the `ActionPrimingAgent`, see its [YAML File](../../../src/agentforge/utils/installer/agents/PredefinedAgents/ActionPrimingAgent.yaml).

## Import Statements
```python
from agentforge.agent import Agent
from ast import literal_eval as eval
```

In this section, the necessary libraries and modules are imported for the functionality of the `ActionPrimingAgent`. The `Agent` class is imported from the `.agentforge/` directory, serving as the base class from which `ActionPrimingAgent` will inherit its core features. Additionally, the Python standard library `ast` (Abstract Syntax Trees) is imported to assist in specific parsing operations.

## Class Definition

```python
class ActionPrimingAgent(Agent):

    def build_output(self, result, **kwargs):
        # ...
        
    def load_additional_data(self):
        # ...
        
    def save_result(self):
        #...
```

The `ActionPrimingAgent` is a specialized agent that inherits its core functionalities from the base `Agent` class. This allows it to utilize the foundational features and methods provided by the `Agent` class. Additionally, `ActionPrimingAgent` customizes its behavior by overriding specific methods from its parent class. Specifically, the methods `build_output`, `load_additional_data`, and `save_result` have been overridden to implement custom functionalities tailored to the needs of this particular agent.

## Overriden Agent Methods

### Load Additional Data
### `load_additional_data()`

**Purpose**: This method adds the current task to the agent's data dictionary.

**Workflow**:
1. Fetches the current task object using `self.functions.get_current_task()`.
2. Adds it to the `self.data['task']`.

```python
def load_additional_data(self):
    self.data['task'] = get_current_task()['document']
```

>**Note:** In this case the `['document']` attribute is the text describing the task to be done as the actual task object has additional metadata attributes.

---

### Build Output
### `build_output()`

**Purpose**: This method formats the result and sets it as the agent's output.

**Workflow**:
1. Removes newlines and tabs from the result.
2. Attempts to evaluate the formatted result as a Python literal expression using `ast.literal_eval`..
3. Sets the evaluated result as the agent's output.

**Exception Handling**: Logs and raises an error if the evaluation fails.

```python
def build_output(self):
    try:
        formatted_result = self.result.replace('\n', '').replace('\t', '')
        self.output = eval(formatted_result)
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.log(self.result, 'error')
        raise ValueError(f"\n\nError while building output for agent: {e}")
```

---

### Save Result
### `save_result()`

**Purpose**: Overrides the default behavior to prevent saving the result to memory.

**Workflow**: Does nothing as there's no need to save how a tool is primed.

```python
def save_result(self):
    pass
```

## How to Use

### Initialization

To utilize the `ActionPrimingAgent`, you first need to initialize it. This is done using the following line of code:

```python
from agentforge.agents.ActionPrimingAgent import ActionPrimingAgent
action_priming_agent = ActionPrimingAgent()
```

### Running the Agent

Once the agent is initialized, you can invoke it to perform its specific tasks by calling the `run` method. This method requires certain parameters:

- `tool`: Represents the tool that needs to be primed.
- `tool_result`: Contains the results returned by the previous execution of the same or different tool. 

The `tool_result` parameter is particularly versatile. In the context of an action sequence, it holds the results from the previous tool execution, whether that's from the same tool or a different one. If this agent is priming the first tool in a sequence, or if the action consists of a single tool, `tool_result` can be set to `None`.

Here's how you would call the agent:

```python
payload = action_priming_agent.run()
```

In this example, the `ActionPrimingAgent` receives a tool and the previous tool results, it will then return a `payload` which contains the tool in it's primed state ready to be executed.

> **Note**: For a more detailed explanation on how we use actions to string tools together in a sequence, please refer to our [Actions Documentation](../../ToolsAndActions/Overview.md)
